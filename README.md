# Flight-On-Time-Performance

#Executive Summary
Air traveling has become one of the most popular transportation modes for long distance travel. Although most people prefer driving, sometimes it is much cheaper to fly many places. We will choose to take flights because of speed and convenience. However, no matter anywhere, there is a significant problem is flight delay, even flight cancellation. At best, people might have to wait extra 10 or 20 minutes. At worst, they might have to wait several hours more, even canceled flights. In this project, I look at domestic flight and airport data for the USA this April (2017). I will not be interested in international airplanes this time because international flights performance involves many uncertain factors, such as political unrest or other political factors. I am mainly interested in whether certain carriers, airports, routes or even the day of travel tend to show more delay than others. Therefore, I believe the data is suitable for further analysis. Hopefully, I am able to make suggestions to people so that they will avoid delay occurring.

#Source of Data
The dataset for my project comes from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In April 2017, 468,330 individual domestic flights were recorded in this dataset. This dataset contains 21 variables, such as Origin, Destination, Cancellation, etc. There are one fact table called flights and five dimension tables.
